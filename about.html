	<h2>About us</h2>
	<p>We are a group of Rutgers students composed of various majors branching off of the School of Engineering. We were given a goal to design and create a product that would satisfy a certain group of people in order to test our capabilities as students who yearn to improve our skills as a team among other things. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We based our project on the legendary childhood phenomenom known as Heelys. What makes our product so unique is the motorized functions which allow users to freely navigate the world using a remote connected to their Motorized Heelys. Without the need to use their legs to, users can leisurely roam about. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
